# SSEF Analysis Tool

The **SSEF Analysis Tool** is a comprehensive financial analysis application designed for the Southampton Student Equity Fund to assist users in evaluating and visualizing stock market data. Built with Python and PyQt5, it provides an interactive GUI for fetching and displaying financial information, charts, and simulations for various ticker symbols.

I have finally gotten around to reorganise the code for the program to just be better organised and threaded.

Please feel free to edit this code and repository with any further ideas.
